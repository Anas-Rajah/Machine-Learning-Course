# Object Detection Project Using Python

# Project Overview:

This project focuses on object detection using Python, a vital application in the field of computer vision. The objective is to develop a computational model or technique to identify the type and location of objects in images and videos. By utilizing deep learning techniques, the project enhances the accuracy of object recognition in complex scenes. A Python program was developed using the OpenCV library to detect objects such as people, cars, and traffic lights with an accuracy of over 60%. The model relies on pre-trained datasets and configuration files to efficiently recognize multiple object classes. This implementation highlights the potential of object detection in real-time applications, providing a robust foundation for future development in areas like surveillance and automated monitoring systems.
